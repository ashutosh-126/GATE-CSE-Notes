# Formula sheet

For n fork calls, then the number of child processes = $$2^n - 1$$
because it's number of processes - one parent process

------
**Arrival Time**: Time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.

**Completion Time**: Time at which process completes its execution.

**Burst Time**: Time required by a process for CPU execution.

**Turn Around Time**: Time Difference between completion time and arrival time.

**Waiting Time(W.T)**: Time Difference between turn around time and burst time.

Turn Around Time = Completion Time  –  Arrival Time

Waiting Time = Turn Around Time  –  Burst Time

Highest Response Ratio Next:

response ratio = (W+S)/S

Here, W is the waiting time of the process so far and S is the Burst time of the process.
